**ðŸ“Œ Midterm Project Proposal: Relation Extraction via Sentence-Pair Modeling**



Hi everyone,



For this project, I will work on a **relation extraction task**, where the goal is to identify the semantic relation between two entities mentioned in a sentence.



I will use the **TACRED dataset**, a large-scale benchmark with over 100,000 sentences and 42 predefined relation types between subject and object entities.



My modeling approach frames this as a **sentence-pair classification problem**, using a **CrossEncoder model** from the sentence-transformers library.
